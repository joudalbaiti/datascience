# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.
# 

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 1. R
# 2. Python
# 3. SQL
# 4. Julia 
# 5. JavaScript

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 
# 1. Pandas

# | Jupyter  |

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[1]:


#This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
# you will multiply 3 to 4 it will equals 15 
# then you will add it to 5 then the iutput is 17 

print ((3*4)+5)


# In[4]:


#  This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
minutes = 200
hours = minutes/ 60
print(hours)
